# PathfindingAlgo_Visualizer
A visualization for 5 different pathfinding algorithms. Choose a start and an end node, place some obstacles and watch the chosen algorithm find and display the found path between the nodes.
Features include: 
- Five different pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A Star, Greedy Best-First, Depth First, Breadth First)
- Maze Generation (Recursive Division)
- Highlighting the found path
- Place walls as obstacles
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
# Instructions
- Place the start (red) and end (green) nodes with LMB
- After placing start and end nodes place walls with LMB
- Remove nodes/walls with RMB
- Choose an algorithm from the drop-down menu and click "Visualize" to start the chosen algorithm
